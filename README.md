# 👋 Hi, I’m Baci Shabedin

Welcome to my GitHub.

🎓 I hold double degrees in **Business Administration**, **Marketing**, and **International Sales**.  
💼 Professionally, I’ve worked across **hospitality**, **technology**, and **web3**, blending strategic management with operational efficiency.

🧠 I’ve completed multiple **coding arguments** and self-taught programs, with a focus on:
- Web3 development (DApps, smart contracts, tokenomics)
- Data analytics & CRM tools
- Business process automation

🚀 I’ve been involved in **crypto trading**, **DeFi**, and even **developed decentralized apps**.  
My journey bridges the gap between business strategy and blockchain implementation.


> 📝 I was *forced* to open this GitHub by friends—but now I’m all in.
